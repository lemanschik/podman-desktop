# Podman Portable
A Portable Podman Installation for Desktop and the Cloud. The Desktop UI Depends on Google Chrome and Works everywhere where Google Chrome is Installed.
The Backend Part works everywhere where podman and nodejs works when it offers a cli interface like a tty or other shell implementation.

## How to Start with NodeJS installed

```
npx podman-portable <optional path>
```

if no path gets supplyed it will use your OS Home Dir and create .podman-portable/{config,ui,host}.
